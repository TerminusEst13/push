"FROM V0.6 TO V0.7:\n\
==================\n\
GAMEPLAY:\n\
- Surfing is no longer as obscenely exploitable as before--when a player bounces repeatedly in mid-air without landing, he will eventually stop bouncing and will just plummet.\n\
- Players are now always bright, for ease of visibility at longer ranges.\n\
- Drones are now faster, fire faster, and their shots speed up. There are also more drone spawns on certain maps.\n\
 ^- Push08\n\
 ^- Push19\n\
 ^- Push10\n\
 ^- Push11\n\
 ^- Push15\n\
 ^- Push18\n\
 ^- Push21\n\
 ^- Push22\n\
 ^- Push24\n\
 ^- Push31\n\
\n\
MAPS:\n\
- Push11 now has both drone spawns and projectile blocking boundaries.\n\
- Push19's been given the Presidential Treatment:\n\
 ^ More efficient method of keeping players off the counter (an invisible 3D floor) end\n\
 ^ Fixed the alignment of some pyramid light textures\n\
 ^ Blue ring platforms are now fully lit and 125% wider\n\
 ^ Raised ceilings above some 3D floors slightly, so they appear on the automap\n\
 ^ Filled the large window in with glass.  The center pane remains open\n\
- Push20's boundaries have been shortened by 2056 units.\n\
- Push27 now has a drone spawn.\n\
- Absolutely nothing was changed about Push28.\n\
- Push30 no longer can teleport lasers into infinity.\n\
- Push32 now has darker borders around the circles to indicate position.\n\
- Push33's center mountains have been removed, and the mountains have been moved to the outer portion of the map. To address camping, there is now an ocean drift on the outside of the map--get thrown out there, and you'll start drifting away!\n\
- Push34's platforms have been trimmed and the belts sped up.\n\
- Push34 has many more spawnpoints now.\n\
- Push35 no longer has player spawns outside of the play boundary.\n\
- Push38's layout has been squeezed in a slight bit, for easier mobility.\n\
- Push43's killfloor has had its depth increased, so it's no longer as easy to trip into it.\n\
- Push46's skybox is no longer obscenely fuckhuge filesize.\n\
- Push47's camp spots have been removed.\n\
- Push47's miscolored water has been colored properly.\n\
- Push49's boundaries have been shortened and the main layout has been expanded.\n\
- Push49 no longer has the water bobbing up and down.\n\
\n\
- A new map, Ichikishimahime Says Keep Your Water Clean by Kurashiki, has been added at Push50.\n\
- A new map, Coffee Break by PresidentPeople, has been added at Push51.\n\
- A new map, Ship of Fools by UniversalQuantifier, has been added at Push52.\n\
- A new map, Samhara Trench by IdeIdoom, has been added at Push53.\n\
- A new map, Dwango 2015 by Gardevoir, has been added at Push54.\n\
- A new map, Burn Baby Burn by Infirnex, has been added at Push55.\n\
- A new map, Jazzy Nostalgia by IdeIdoom, has been added at Push56.\n\
- A new map, Bullseye by Sgt. Shivers, has been added at Push57.\n\
- A new map, Heifong Virtual Arena by Marty Kirra, has been added at Push58.\n\
- A new map, Push-Mortem by Untitled, has been added at Push59.\n\
- A new map, Castle of Griefing by PresidentPeople, has been added at Push60.\n\
- A new map, Serpent Riders' Playhouse by Gothic, has been added at Push61.\n\
- A new map, Island Retreat by PresidentPeople, has been added at Push62.\n\
\n\
POLISH:\n\
- Sgt. Shivers has provided the best titlepic.\n\
- All SNDINFO entries have been separated by map.\n\
- Push19 had had a massive wipe of polish across the entire board, with more effects, prettier textures, and some new additions.\n\
- Push24 now has over double the banners. Thanks to everyone for submitting!\n\
- Push31's HOMs behind the banner has been removed.\n\
- Push34 now has rain and lightning.\n\
- Push30 now has a Startropics enemy wandering about.\n\
- Push38 has been given its proper skybox.\n\
- Several misaligned sectors in Push43 have been re-aligned. Not all of them, but quite a few.\n\
- Push48 has been given more even lighting across the board.\n\
\n\
WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE DETAIL:\n\
- It's no longer possible to dive into the Cacodemon's mouth in Push17 and hide there.\n\
- The edges of Push31's banner have been pushed against the cake.\n\
- It's no longer possible to hide behind the house in Push38.\n\
- The torches in the Push38 house's corner have been brought in, to keep people from butthugging the corner.\n\
- The hole in the center of Push39 has been risen up, and the pillars pulled back.";
