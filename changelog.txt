FROM V0.4 TO V0.5:
==================
GAMEPLAY:
- Levels that are too bright now automatically give the players items that turn shots translucent, rather than additive.
- Players now have an inventory item that activates a wallhack visor, which allows them to see exactly where other players are located.

POLISH:
- Player is now slightly smaller, with a scale of 0.9.
- Push32/Limitless level now starts off with the "Welcome to zombo.com" message

WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE DETAIL:
