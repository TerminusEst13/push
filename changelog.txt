FROM V0.6 TO V0.7:
==================
GAMEPLAY:

- Players are now always bright, for ease of visibility at longer ranges.
- Drones are now faster, fire faster, and their shots speed up. There are also more drone spawns on certain maps.

FROM V0.5 TO V0.6:
==================
GAMEPLAY:
- Cacodemons on Push17 are easier to hit and no longer so stupidly aggressive.
- The explosion radius of the grenade has been increased by 16 units, for slightly easier recoveries.
- The alt-fire of the gauntlet is now capable of reflecting shots away from the player. It's not graphically visible until a Zandronum bug is fixed, but it's an actual thing now nonetheless.
- Weapon switching is now a little under twice as fast.
- Both weapons' alt-fires had their WRF_NOSWITCH times slashed in half, meaning players will be able to swap to a different weapon much faster.
- The visor now tracks people better, updating its position in half the time as before.
- The Push laser speed has been increased from 400 to 450, and its radius increased from 3 to 4.
- The Push laser now fires straight at the crosshair, rather than 8 units underneath.
- A drawing utensil has been implemented as an extra key for the people who think of Push as a multiplayer MSPaint simulator.
- The F1 help screen is no longer the best but now is much more informative.
- The Doom pistol is now removed from the player on map enter.
- Deathmatch support has been implemented. It's a little wonky and isn't perfect until the engine can track who pushed who off, but it's a decent little timewaster in the meantime.
- The lightamp of the wallhack visor worked in Software but didn't work in OpenGL. Not sure why. Until I can figure out why, it's been removed.


MAPS:
- Absolutely nothing about Push28 was changed.
- The teleporters on Push11 have been lowered and their textures changed, for easier jumping-into and location differentiation.
- Push33's amount of actors has been dramatically cut down to a third of what it was, and filesize was reduced from over three megabytes to barely 1.6. This should help make the map less laggy.
- Push27 has been expanded and the center arena filled in. This should make the arena more difficult to recover from, and slightly more difficult to get knocked off.
- The center platform in PUSH04 has been raised so people can react easier to trips. The outer ring has been expanded so one simple nudge doesn't throw people off, but has lowered so getting thrown off requires more reaction.

- The scan visor has been edited to be centered.
- The floor in Push13 is no longer bugged.
- PUSH17's sides now are a different shade of red than the floor, for easier differentiation.


WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE DETAIL:
- PUSH06's lower platforms have been raised up to prevent people from camping there.
- The mushroom platform in PUSH10 has been removed.

- Players now have an inventory item that activates a wallhack visor, which allows them to see exactly where other players are located.
