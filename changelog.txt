FROM V0.5 TO V0.6:
==================
GAMEPLAY:
- Cacodemons on Push17 are easier to hit and no longer so stupidly aggressive.
- The explosion radius of the grenade has been increased by 16 units, for slightly easier recoveries.
- The alt-fire of the gauntlet is now capable of reflecting shots away from the player.

MAPS:
- Absolutely nothing about Push28 was changed.
- The teleporters on Push11 have been lowered and their textures changed, for easier jumping-into and location differentiation.
- Push33's amount of actors has been dramatically cut down to a third of what it was, and filesize was reduced from over three megabytes to barely 1.6. This should help make the map less laggy.
- Push27 has been expanded and the center arena filled in. This should make the arena more difficult to recover from, and slightly more difficult to get knocked off.
- The center platform in PUSH04 has been raised so people can react easier to trips. The outer ring has been expanded so one simple nudge doesn't throw people off, but has lowered so getting thrown off requires more reaction.
- PUSH35's main arena was made smaller, and the walls stretched further out. It should be easier to knock people off now.
- A new map, the XXX ImpBar by Mystical, has been added at Push37.
- PUSH36 has been dramatically ensmallened and now can actually be recovered from.
- PUSH17 has smaller walls to make it easier to recover and a few floating platforms for a little bit of Z-axis action.
- PUSH30 has had the laggy pyramids removed, and many many more spawn points placed throughout the area.

POLISH:
- Push10 was renamed to "Above the 8-Bit Freeway" and Push33 renamed to "Atlantis Highway", as per author request.
- Push27 now has lava balls spurting up every now and then.
- The lollipops in PUSH31 are now transparent, and the alignments on the chocolate bar were fixed.
- UnholyPimpin has added a nice little touch to PUSH17, in honor of our Cacoward. Thanks, mate!

WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE DETAIL:



FROM V0.4 TO V0.5:
==================
GAMEPLAY:
- Levels that are too bright now automatically give the players items that turn shots translucent, rather than additive.
- Players now have an inventory item that activates a wallhack visor, which allows them to see exactly where other players are located.
- Sudden Death Drones now have their mass halved, meaning they can be pushed about. Taking "damage" makes them forget about their target and wander about for a bit.
- The Gauntlet alt-fire now does a whole -2 recoil instead of -1.

MAPS:
- Thanks to PresidentPeople, Push32 has had the circles slowly peter out in darkness, for easier identification of where you are.
- The height of Push32 has been increased, and players will no longer be scraping against the ceiling after four minutes.
- The grey rocks on Push22 are now colored red, for easier identification of kill floors.
- Push31 has had the height of the cake lowered, less 3D floors, and the platforms brought closer to the center.
- The sudden death drones should now work on Push31 and Push22.
- Everyone now spawns at the same height on Push23. No more spawning next to lava.
- The glowing lights on Push24 have resumed their original jumppad behavior in SpaceDM5.
- The stone walls on Push27 are now different colors than the floor textures, for easier differentiation between floor and wall.
- Now no player spawns on Push16 are on an area sinkable into the floor.
- The small ledges outside the center platform on Push12 are no longer instant kill.
- Push25 has been replaced with Start to Crate, by W1D3A55.
- Push30 has been dramatically rehauled, and both the map and the textures themselves are now much larger.
- Push10 has been replaced with Funs in the Nighttime, by Tango.
- Push11 has been replaced with the Big-Ass Teleporter, by IdeIdoom.
- Push17 now has little babby cacos coming out of the mouth every ten seconds.
- Push33 has been implemented, Coral Circuit by Tango.
- Push34 has been implemented, the Dreadmill by Infirnex.
- Push35 has been implemented, the Nexus by Madokage.
- Push36 has been implemented, Polygons are Inaccurate by Rofl25.

POLISH:
- Player is now slightly smaller, with a scale of 0.9.
- Push32 level now starts off with the "Welcome to zombo.com" message
- The moire texture on Push29 has been recolored to be easier on the eyes.

WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE DETAIL:
- The red pillars on Push22 have been lowered so that people can no longer hide behind them.
- The grates on the towers have had their texture replaced with a more easy-to-see-through alternative so that players can no longer hide as easily behind them.
- The tracks on Push08 no longer are above the ground, but are now flat with the ground, so that people can no longer hang on the edge to avoid death.
- The large smoke tower on Push21 has been removed to stop people from hiding behind it.
- The floating skull/cacodemon pyramids on Push23 have been inverted to stop people from camping behind it.
- The hazard pillars in Push24 have been moved to the center island so as to stop people from camping behind them.
- The pillars underneath the middle bridge in Push29 have been lowered so as to keep people from camping behind them.
