FROM V0.5 TO V0.6:
==================
GAMEPLAY:
- Cacodemons on Push17 are easier to hit and no longer so stupidly aggressive.
- The explosion radius of the grenade has been increased by 16 units, for slightly easier recoveries.
- The alt-fire of the gauntlet is now capable of reflecting shots away from the player.
- Weapon switching is now a little under twice as fast.
- Both weapons' alt-fires had their WRF_NOSWITCH times slashed in half, meaning players will be able to swap to a different weapon much faster.
- The visor now tracks people better, updating its position in half the time as before.
- The Push laser speed has been increased from 400 to 450, and its radius increased from 3 to 4.
- The Push laser now fires straight at the crosshair, rather than 8 units underneath.
- A drawing utensil has been implemented as an extra key for the people who think of Push as a multiplayer MSPaint simulator.
- The F1 help screen is no longer the best but now is much more informative.
- The Doom pistol is now removed from the player on map enter.


MAPS:
- Absolutely nothing about Push28 was changed.
- The teleporters on Push11 have been lowered and their textures changed, for easier jumping-into and location differentiation.
- Push33's amount of actors has been dramatically cut down to a third of what it was, and filesize was reduced from over three megabytes to barely 1.6. This should help make the map less laggy.
- Push27 has been expanded and the center arena filled in. This should make the arena more difficult to recover from, and slightly more difficult to get knocked off.
- The center platform in PUSH04 has been raised so people can react easier to trips. The outer ring has been expanded so one simple nudge doesn't throw people off, but has lowered so getting thrown off requires more reaction.
- PUSH35's main arena was made smaller, and the walls stretched further out. It should be easier to knock people off now.
- PUSH36 has been dramatically ensmallened and now can actually be recovered from.
- PUSH36 now has a defined ground texture.
- PUSH17 has smaller walls to make it easier to recover and a few floating platforms for a little bit of Z-axis action.
- PUSH30 has had the laggy pyramids removed, and many many more spawn points placed throughout the area.
- PUSH34's silos have been expanded for more safe ground.
- PUSH32's pillars now have black edges.

- A new map, the XXX ImpBar by Mystical, has been added at Push37.
- A new map, Ice Ice Baby by UniversalQuantifier, has been added at Push38.

- A new map, Mandatory Void Tribute by IdeIdoom, has been added at Push43.
- A new map, Sinking Feeling by Gardevoir, has been added at Push44.
- A new map, The Future of the Year 2000 by Gothic, has been added at Push45.

POLISH:
- Push10 was renamed to "Above the 8-Bit Freeway" and Push33 renamed to "Atlantis Highway", as per author request.
- Push27 now has lava balls spurting up every now and then.
- The lollipops in PUSH31 are now transparent, and the alignments on the chocolate bar were fixed.
- UnholyPimpin has added a nice little touch to PUSH17, in honor of our Cacoward. Thanks, mate!
- PUSH34's skybox has been tweaked to look a little prettier.
- The doublejump indicator now has text on it to identify that, yes, this is for double-jump.
- The doublejump indicator now empties out when used instead of vanishing.


WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE DETAIL:
- PUSH06's lower platforms have been raised up to prevent people from camping there.



FROM V0.4 TO V0.5:

- Players now have an inventory item that activates a wallhack visor, which allows them to see exactly where other players are located.

MAPS:
- Thanks to PresidentPeople, Push32 has had the circles slowly peter out in darkness, for easier identification of where you are.
- The height of Push32 has been increased, and players will no longer be scraping against the ceiling after four minutes.
- The grey rocks on Push22 are now colored red, for easier identification of kill floors.
- Push31 has had the height of the cake lowered, less 3D floors, and the platforms brought closer to the center.
- The sudden death drones should now work on Push31 and Push22.
- Everyone now spawns at the same height on Push23. No more spawning next to lava.
- The glowing lights on Push24 have resumed their original jumppad behavior in SpaceDM5.

- The moire texture on Push29 has been recolored to be easier on the eyes.

WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE DETAIL:
- The red pillars on Push22 have been lowered so that people can no longer hide behind them.
- The grates on the towers have had their texture replaced with a more easy-to-see-through alternative so that players can no longer hide as easily behind them.
- The tracks on Push08 no longer are above the ground, but are now flat with the ground, so that people can no longer hang on the edge to avoid death.
- The large smoke tower on Push21 has been removed to stop people from hiding behind it.
- The floating skull/cacodemon pyramids on Push23 have been inverted to stop people from camping behind it.
- The hazard pillars in Push24 have been moved to the center island so as to stop people from camping behind them.
