<topsrs> is dwango5 map01 a map choice
<topsrs> failing that, just plain map01
<TerminusEst13> jen nooooo :(
<TerminusEst13> Actually a Push-ified Dwango5 Map01 would be really cool. I guess I'll do that for my third map.

Smooth up the circle on push12

Fist alt-fire should reflect projectiles

Push push20's insta-kill-when-lower code on push16's platforms.

push19 has you spawn on 3d floor

Timer for respawn protection / Powerup that fades out after two seconds.

A_Stop on Death.

Push21 needs more buildings.

Fix mismatched colors on F1 help screen.

<PresidentPeople> The short ones coming out of the brown blocks
