<topsrs> is dwango5 map01 a map choice
<topsrs> failing that, just plain map01
<TerminusEst13> Actually a Push-ified Dwango5 Map01 would be really cool. I guess I'll do that for my third map.

Fist alt-fire should reflect projectiles

Push push20's insta-kill-when-lower code on push16's platforms.

Push21 needs more buildings.

Push10 needs a dramatic overhaul. It's laggy and far too easy to stall/camp on.

THere needs to be a reason to use the teleporter in push03, at the moment it's only a trap.

In push17 (Caco), needs to play OM NOM NOM when someone enters his mouth.


[06:27:59 pm] playe: hey term
[06:28:01 pm] TerminusEst13: Yo.
[06:28:09 pm] playe: are you going to make the spawn sound a dial up tone as well?
[06:28:17 pm] TerminusEst13: ...hahaha, that's a good idea.
[06:28:24 pm] playe: i think so, if doable
[06:28:34 pm] PresidentPeople: Heh, dialup


[06:32:36 pm] PresidentPeople: Getting dunked should call and A_Quake on the victim
[06:32:46 pm] PresidentPeople: for extra dunk feels


<Marcaek> TerminusEst13, perhaps some kind of less random mode to spawn in a drone every X intervals?
<Marcaek> or wait
<Marcaek> random spawn point :?
<TerminusEst13> That's a good idea. I'll go with that, thanks.
<Marcaek> oooh

Replace teleport fog. Reverse version of the player deaths?

Push20 and push34 needs one player 1 start.

Painting/drawing utensil
 ^- Special key which fires a constant stream of bulletpuffs.

Slow down ground on push08


<PresidentPeople> The camp spot [in Push24] was moved to the middle, but the outer platform is pretty bare now
<PresidentPeople> what about a slope up to the jump pad?
<PresidentPeople> That is, a slope to a slightly higher shelf


<PresidentPeople> Small issue on the StarTropics map.  There's a very tiny ledge behind Mike's portrait, but only on his left, strangely

On push32, darken the lines on the edges.


<Untitled> unless your map is very complex (lots of detail and whatnot), sheer size shouldn't be that deadly
<PresidentPeople> I know people asked for big maps, but they're turning out to be hard to play on once the players dwindle away
<TerminusEst13> Yeah.
<PresidentPeople> Whether they're survivors, or a small group to begin with
<WaTaKiD> so have the map shrink depending on # players left :p
<WaTaKiD> some outer pillars lower to the floor or something idk
<TerminusEst13> That's not a bad idea, Wata.
<PresidentPeople> yeah, that sounds neat
<TerminusEst13> It'll take revising and rebuilding every single big map available, but it's possible with GetPlayerCount.
<WaTaKiD> gl hf
<WaTaKiD> if that idea causes more trouble than its worth in the end, my apologies lol



<DRL333> Speaking of faces, I know why the face texture in Push13 doesn't look right in software
<DRL333> The texture's resoulution is causing it to bork in software
<DRL333> It's the same thing that's happening to the NES is Seth's map
<DRL333> Changing the resoultion to something like 256 x 256 should fix it



Make push10's flashing red/blue textures less frequent

Panel 2: If you get launched off, recover! Use your double-jump and rocketjump off the killfloor to make it back!
Panel 3: If someone is hiding, use Activate Inventory to scan for their location.
Panel 4: BE THIS GUY, DON'T BE THIS GUY




uq-pushmap.wad (Save for Zandro 2.0)
TerminusEst13: Would you be all right with it if I moved the pillars on the east and the west back a little bit to the edge of the platforms? I can already see players wanting to hide behind them to let everyone else fight it out.
universal quantifier: Sure
