<topsrs> is dwango5 map01 a map choice
<topsrs> failing that, just plain map01
<TerminusEst13> Actually a Push-ified Dwango5 Map01 would be really cool. I guess I'll do that for my third map.

Fist alt-fire should reflect projectiles

Push push20's insta-kill-when-lower code on push16's platforms.

Push21 needs more buildings.

Push10 needs a dramatic overhaul. It's laggy and far too easy to stall/camp on.

In push16, you can sometimes spawn on the insta-kill stuff after the platforms have lowered.

THere needs to be a reason to use the teleporter in push03, at the moment it's only a trap.

In push17 (Caco), needs to play OM NOM NOM when someone enters his mouth.


<LegoCS> First, the asymmetry in the middle bridge due to the size extensions is a little annoying [ https://www.dropbox.com/s/fz0u7afwolo2w9t/Screenshot_Doom_20141120_162232.png?dl=0 ]
<LegoCS> Second there are instance under certain 3D bridges don't have scrolling [though this might be my fault]
<LegoCS> Finally the totodile should be hidden, not sitting just outside where it is supposed to be hidden [ https://www.dropbox.com/s/mygxv7b06ly4akh/Screenshot_Doom_20141120_162851.png?dl=0 ]

[06:28:09 pm] playe: are you going to make the spawn sound a dial up tone as well?
[06:28:17 pm] TerminusEst13: ...hahaha, that's a good idea.
[06:28:24 pm] playe: i think so, if doable
[06:28:34 pm] PresidentPeople: Heh, dialup


[06:32:36 pm] PresidentPeople: Getting dunked should call and A_Quake on the victim
[06:32:46 pm] PresidentPeople: for extra dunk feels


[06:51:24 pm] PresidentPeople: You should be able to push away drones
[06:51:37 pm] PresidentPeople: it won't interrupt them, but you can help spread them out
[06:52:02 pm] PresidentPeople: possibly to the shooter's advantage


Shadows under platforms in push09.


Get rid of camp corners in push29.
