<topsrs> is dwango5 map01 a map choice
<topsrs> failing that, just plain map01
<TerminusEst13> Actually a Push-ified Dwango5 Map01 would be really cool. I guess I'll do that for my third map.

Fist alt-fire should reflect projectiles

Push push20's insta-kill-when-lower code on push16's platforms.

Push21 needs more buildings.

Push10 needs a dramatic overhaul. It's laggy and far too easy to stall/camp on.

In push16, you can sometimes spawn on the insta-kill stuff after the platforms have lowered.

THere needs to be a reason to use the teleporter in push03, at the moment it's only a trap.

In push17 (Caco), needs to play OM NOM NOM when someone enters his mouth.


[06:27:59 pm] playe: hey term
[06:28:01 pm] TerminusEst13: Yo.
[06:28:09 pm] playe: are you going to make the spawn sound a dial up tone as well?
[06:28:17 pm] TerminusEst13: ...hahaha, that's a good idea.
[06:28:24 pm] playe: i think so, if doable
[06:28:34 pm] PresidentPeople: Heh, dialup


[06:32:36 pm] PresidentPeople: Getting dunked should call and A_Quake on the victim
[06:32:46 pm] PresidentPeople: for extra dunk feels


[06:51:24 pm] PresidentPeople: You should be able to push away drones
[06:51:37 pm] PresidentPeople: it won't interrupt them, but you can help spread them out
[06:52:02 pm] PresidentPeople: possibly to the shooter's advantage


Shadows under platforms in push09.


Push32 needs to remove the HOM.

Push31 needs its 130 mapspot spawns double-checked. Also, what's keeping the jump icon from working?

"Welcome, to zombocom" voiceclip on entering map32.


<Marcaek> TerminusEst13, perhaps some kind of less random mode to spawn in a drone every X intervals?
<Marcaek> or wait
<Marcaek> random spawn point :?
<TerminusEst13> That's a good idea. I'll go with that, thanks.
<Marcaek> oooh


Push17 should have cacodemons coming out of the mouth


Push22 should have the grey rocks colored red.



Remove camping spots at push24, push23, push21


Replace teleport fog. Reverse version of the player deaths?

Under bridge in push29 is a terrible camp area


Lower the layers of the cake in Push31
Why don't the fun police spawn in push31?
Can hide behind the cake and flan in push31


Raise the ceiling on push32
"Welcome to zombo.com" on push32 intro.


Flatten the tracks on push08 so people can't camp there.


People can camp behind the pillars on push24. Move to center sections.


Push24's new lights don't flash.

Glowing lights in push24 shoul be jumppads.

Replace push25.

The stone walls on push27 should be different textures from the floor.

Push29's moire patterning hurts people's eyes. Replace with something cleaner.
Darken push29's textures slightly.

Tweak the brightness on push32, people are having trouble seeing shots.

little ledges outside the center platform on push12 kill people.

TerminusEst13: Would you be all right with it if I moved the pillars on the east and the west back a little bit to the edge of the platforms? I can already see players wanting to hide behind them to let everyone else fight it out.
universal quantifier: Sure
