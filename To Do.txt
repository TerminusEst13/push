<topsrs> is dwango5 map01 a map choice
<topsrs> failing that, just plain map01
<TerminusEst13> Actually a Push-ified Dwango5 Map01 would be really cool. I guess I'll do that for my third map.

Fist alt-fire should reflect projectiles

Push push20's insta-kill-when-lower code on push16's platforms.

Push21 needs more buildings.

Push10 needs a dramatic overhaul. It's laggy and far too easy to stall/camp on.

THere needs to be a reason to use the teleporter in push03, at the moment it's only a trap.

In push17 (Caco), needs to play OM NOM NOM when someone enters his mouth.


[06:27:59 pm] playe: hey term
[06:28:01 pm] TerminusEst13: Yo.
[06:28:09 pm] playe: are you going to make the spawn sound a dial up tone as well?
[06:28:17 pm] TerminusEst13: ...hahaha, that's a good idea.
[06:28:24 pm] playe: i think so, if doable
[06:28:34 pm] PresidentPeople: Heh, dialup


[06:32:36 pm] PresidentPeople: Getting dunked should call and A_Quake on the victim
[06:32:46 pm] PresidentPeople: for extra dunk feels


Shadows under platforms in push09.


<Marcaek> TerminusEst13, perhaps some kind of less random mode to spawn in a drone every X intervals?
<Marcaek> or wait
<Marcaek> random spawn point :?
<TerminusEst13> That's a good idea. I'll go with that, thanks.
<Marcaek> oooh

Replace teleport fog. Reverse version of the player deaths?

Push20 needs one player 1 start.

Implement in-game credits/changelog.

TerminusEst13: Would you be all right with it if I moved the pillars on the east and the west back a little bit to the edge of the platforms? I can already see players wanting to hide behind them to let everyone else fight it out.
universal quantifier: Sure
