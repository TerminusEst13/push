<topsrs> is dwango5 map01 a map choice
<topsrs> failing that, just plain map01
<TerminusEst13> Actually a Push-ified Dwango5 Map01 would be really cool. I guess I'll do that for my third map.

Push push20's insta-kill-when-lower code on push16's platforms.

Push21 needs more buildings.

THere needs to be a reason to use the teleporter in push03, at the moment it's only a trap.

In push17 (Caco), needs to play OM NOM NOM when someone enters his mouth.


[06:27:59 pm] playe: hey term
[06:28:01 pm] TerminusEst13: Yo.
[06:28:09 pm] playe: are you going to make the spawn sound a dial up tone as well?
[06:28:17 pm] TerminusEst13: ...hahaha, that's a good idea.
[06:28:24 pm] playe: i think so, if doable
[06:28:34 pm] PresidentPeople: Heh, dialup



[06:32:36 pm] PresidentPeople: Getting dunked should call and A_Quake on the victim
[06:32:46 pm] PresidentPeople: for extra dunk feels


<Marcaek> TerminusEst13, perhaps some kind of less random mode to spawn in a drone every X intervals?
<Marcaek> or wait
<Marcaek> random spawn point :?
<TerminusEst13> That's a good idea. I'll go with that, thanks.
<Marcaek> oooh

Replace teleport fog. Reverse version of the player deaths?

Push20 and push34 needs one player 1 start.

Slow down ground on push08


<PresidentPeople> The camp spot [in Push24] was moved to the middle, but the outer platform is pretty bare now
<PresidentPeople> what about a slope up to the jump pad?
<PresidentPeople> That is, a slope to a slightly higher shelf


<PresidentPeople> Small issue on the StarTropics map.  There's a very tiny ledge behind Mike's portrait, but only on his left, strangely


<Untitled> unless your map is very complex (lots of detail and whatnot), sheer size shouldn't be that deadly
<PresidentPeople> I know people asked for big maps, but they're turning out to be hard to play on once the players dwindle away
<TerminusEst13> Yeah.
<PresidentPeople> Whether they're survivors, or a small group to begin with
<WaTaKiD> so have the map shrink depending on # players left :p
<WaTaKiD> some outer pillars lower to the floor or something idk
<TerminusEst13> That's not a bad idea, Wata.
<PresidentPeople> yeah, that sounds neat
<TerminusEst13> It'll take revising and rebuilding every single big map available, but it's possible with GetPlayerCount.
<WaTaKiD> gl hf
<WaTaKiD> if that idea causes more trouble than its worth in the end, my apologies lol



<DRL333> Speaking of faces, I know why the face texture in Push13 doesn't look right in software
<DRL333> The texture's resoulution is causing it to bork in software
<DRL333> It's the same thing that's happening to the NES is Seth's map
<DRL333> Changing the resoultion to something like 256 x 256 should fix it




FOR v0.6:
===============
New:




UPDATE CREDITS/CHANGELOG, INCORPORATE IN-GAME
Raise ceiling on Push39
Reduce smoke on Push41
Push47 needs removed. Respawning doesn't work well with the rising water, and when the match ends the colored lighting fugs up.
Tweak visor scanner HUD to fix off-center thing
Make push10's flashing red/blue textures less frequent
Push25's southwest stack has some misaligned brown/black crates.
Push18's northwest billards needs fixed textures.
"Please read, a personal appeal from TerminusEst13" ad for push25.
Push28's easter egg doesn't work online





uq-pushmap.wad (Save for Zandro 2.0)
TerminusEst13: Would you be all right with it if I moved the pillars on the east and the west back a little bit to the edge of the platforms? I can already see players wanting to hide behind them to let everyone else fight it out.
universal quantifier: Sure



FOR LATER:
==============
TheUnrealRogue-PUSHMAP.wad (Needs a dramatic rehaul)
shivers-Desert Track.wad (Ditto)
Gardie-PUSH02-Welcome_To_Vinesauce.wad (ditto)
