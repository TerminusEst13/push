<topsrs> is dwango5 map01 a map choice

Fist alt-fire should reflect projectiles

Push push20's insta-kill-when-lower code on push16's platforms.

Push21 needs more buildings.

Push10 needs a dramatic overhaul. It's laggy and far too easy to stall/camp on.

Triangle platforms are misaligned on push16.

In push16, you can sometimes spawn on the insta-kill stuff after the platforms have lowered.

Increase height of killfloor on push09 so people can recover a bit more easily.

THere needs to be a reason to use the teleporter in push03, at the moment it's only a trap.

Change billboards on push24/25 to be something more relevant. Maybe other, interesting mods? Made-up stuff?

Remove all weapons/items on Push24/25.

Expand out push24/25, make it more open to jump from rooftop to rooftop. Rise ceiling. Close off buildings.

Fix all missing textures on push24/25.

Expand treetops on push26, include projectile-blocking walls and mapspot tagged 130.
