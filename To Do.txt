<topsrs> is dwango5 map01 a map choice
<topsrs> failing that, just plain map01
<TerminusEst13> Actually a Push-ified Dwango5 Map01 would be really cool. I guess I'll do that for my third map.

Fist alt-fire should reflect projectiles

Push push20's insta-kill-when-lower code on push16's platforms.

Push21 needs more buildings.

Push10 needs a dramatic overhaul. It's laggy and far too easy to stall/camp on.

In push16, you can sometimes spawn on the insta-kill stuff after the platforms have lowered.

THere needs to be a reason to use the teleporter in push03, at the moment it's only a trap.

Push11's (Bowser) holes really need patched.

Push25 (Twitter) needs to be brighter.

In push17 (Caco), needs to play OM NOM NOM when someone enters his mouth.

Push22 (Crucible) needs to be a lot smaller, less laggy, and less safe.

On Push16 (Icon), replace Zombieman with Romero.
