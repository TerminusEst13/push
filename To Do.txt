<topsrs> is dwango5 map01 a map choice
<topsrs> failing that, just plain map01
<TerminusEst13> Actually a Push-ified Dwango5 Map01 would be really cool. I guess I'll do that for my third map.

Push push20's insta-kill-when-lower code on push16's platforms.

Push21 needs more buildings.

THere needs to be a reason to use the teleporter in push03, at the moment it's only a trap.


[06:27:59 pm] playe: hey term
[06:28:01 pm] TerminusEst13: Yo.
[06:28:09 pm] playe: are you going to make the spawn sound a dial up tone as well?
[06:28:17 pm] TerminusEst13: ...hahaha, that's a good idea.
[06:28:24 pm] playe: i think so, if doable
[06:28:34 pm] PresidentPeople: Heh, dialup



[06:32:36 pm] PresidentPeople: Getting dunked should call and A_Quake on the victim
[06:32:46 pm] PresidentPeople: for extra dunk feels


<Marcaek> TerminusEst13, perhaps some kind of less random mode to spawn in a drone every X intervals?
<Marcaek> or wait
<Marcaek> random spawn point :?
<TerminusEst13> That's a good idea. I'll go with that, thanks.
<Marcaek> oooh

Replace teleport fog. Reverse version of the player deaths?

Push20 and push34 needs one player 1 start.

Slow down ground on push08


<PresidentPeople> The camp spot [in Push24] was moved to the middle, but the outer platform is pretty bare now
<PresidentPeople> what about a slope up to the jump pad?
<PresidentPeople> That is, a slope to a slightly higher shelf


<PresidentPeople> Small issue on the StarTropics map.  There's a very tiny ledge behind Mike's portrait, but only on his left, strangely


<Untitled> unless your map is very complex (lots of detail and whatnot), sheer size shouldn't be that deadly
<PresidentPeople> I know people asked for big maps, but they're turning out to be hard to play on once the players dwindle away
<TerminusEst13> Yeah.
<PresidentPeople> Whether they're survivors, or a small group to begin with
<WaTaKiD> so have the map shrink depending on # players left :p
<WaTaKiD> some outer pillars lower to the floor or something idk
<TerminusEst13> That's not a bad idea, Wata.
<PresidentPeople> yeah, that sounds neat
<TerminusEst13> It'll take revising and rebuilding every single big map available, but it's possible with GetPlayerCount.
<WaTaKiD> gl hf
<WaTaKiD> if that idea causes more trouble than its worth in the end, my apologies lol



<DRL333> Speaking of faces, I know why the face texture in Push13 doesn't look right in software
<DRL333> The texture's resoulution is causing it to bork in software
<DRL333> It's the same thing that's happening to the NES is Seth's map
<DRL333> Changing the resoultion to something like 256 x 256 should fix it



<playe> hey i have a terribad idea for push: you know the handicap option in DM, where you can give yourself less HP?
<TerminusEst13> Aye.
<playe> it might be interesting if there was a way of changing a player's mass so one shot could send them flying crazily
<playe> obviously that comes with alot of problems too, which is why i preface it with "terribad"
<playe> but i thought it would be interesting
<TerminusEst13> Hmmmm.
<TerminusEst13> I might need to experiment with this, because the idea is certainly interesting.
<playe> i'm glad you think so
<playe> if i was working on it i would approach the idea with caution
<playe> because it could create some balance issues
<playe> but a match with heavier vs lighter players seems interesting
<TerminusEst13> I'll probably start it off as a global cvar that effects everybody, and then expand from there.



<playe> so we're on push27 right now
<playe> and police aren't spawning, and people are making a few suggestions
<playe> a) widen the big ole hole in the center b) squeeze in the spokes/narrow the bridge part (so it's like four circles on a hub?? idk how to explain it) or c) perhaps make the map less safe somehow
<playe> lastly d) maybe purdy it up some more by adding a crack/fissure running from the center to edges



Push47 has a very blatant corner to hide in.

People can slip into the area under PUSH42's center beam.

<playe> reason you can't have nice detail reason #6661999: push41's pillars have little notches where players can hide in/behind



Bottom-right white tusk on push17 is too low.



Billboard in Push33 can be camped.
Roads need to be a bit tighter, rocks need much further out


Hard limit for alt-fire surfing--when in mid-air, each shot drains from a counter--after ten shots, they stop pushing you up. Landing on the floor restores the counter.



Make spawn protection a cl cvar.



<playe> now that's what i call bullshit suggestions vol 2: hey why doesn't the push quit message blurb say something like "please don't go, there's more demons to push"
<TerminusEst13> Hahaha. I should probably include some custom Push quit messages.
<playe> "please don't go, the drones need you, they look up to you"


<Roman6a> hey TerminusEst13 i found a bug in push, on map push38 if you spend your doublejump and land on a tree, you will regain your doublejump but the image on your hud will not reflect this
<Roman6a> dunno if it happens on other maps


universal quantifier: I also figured out why the sky looks all wrong on my previous map, there's another texture called ICESKY on Push43 which overrides the one on my map
universal quantifier: Just rename either one and it should look as intended
universal quantifier: as long as you remember to update mapinfo
TerminusEst13: Ohhhhhhh. That would explain it.



Brighten up the player sprites.


[push37]
[03:44:29 pm] mumble: hey term, how about if you could on this map get thrown into the back room at the end of the catwalk, but go out of bounds
[03:44:35 pm] mumble: and you hear girls screaming


Pillars in push39 need to be lowered.

Push25's southwest stack has some misaligned brown/black crates.
"Please read, a personal appeal from TerminusEst13" ad for push24.

Incorporate the rest of the banners


Tourney mode cvar that removes all hazards

Terminator mode where one person gets a super-push Railgun

Support for buckshot/instagib modes?


One under-bridge waterfloor on push49 and outer-edge doesn't rise/lower.


push30 doesn't have projectile-blocking walls or fun police spawn.
 ^- Probably not push11, either.


Spawns are broken on push35, so many spawn outside.


Southwest corner on southeast building in push47 has an easily-campable spot.


Account system integration to track stats?


CL cvar to turn off flashing on hit.


Push38 is incredibly easy to camp next to the torches and the house.






uq-pushmap.wad (Save for Zandro 2.0)
TerminusEst13: Would you be all right with it if I moved the pillars on the east and the west back a little bit to the edge of the platforms? I can already see players wanting to hide behind them to let everyone else fight it out.
universal quantifier: Sure
