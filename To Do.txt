<topsrs> is dwango5 map01 a map choice
<topsrs> failing that, just plain map01
<TerminusEst13> jen nooooo :(
<TerminusEst13> Actually a Push-ified Dwango5 Map01 would be really cool. I guess I'll do that for my third map.

Smooth up the circle on push12

Fist alt-fire should reflect projectiles

Push push20's insta-kill-when-lower code on push16's platforms.

push21 has you spawn on 3d floor

Timer for respawn protection / Powerup that fades out after two seconds.

A_Stop on Death.

Push21 needs more buildings.

Fix mismatched colors on F1 help screen.

<PresidentPeople> TerminusEst13: Playe reports an issue with Push22.  Too many spots to hide in
<PresidentPeople> The thin ledges that make up the outlying towers are easy to camp on, out of sight
<PresidentPeople> I'd check the lava falls as well
<PresidentPeople> The short ones coming out of the brown blocks

Push12 needs tweaked a little more. Implement skybox, have spinning data-rings around it CYDM01 style. Floor should be circuitry.

Push10 needs a dramatic overhaul. It's laggy and far too easy to stall/camp on.
