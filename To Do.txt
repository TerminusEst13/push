<topsrs> is dwango5 map01 a map choice
<topsrs> failing that, just plain map01
<TerminusEst13> Actually a Push-ified Dwango5 Map01 would be really cool. I guess I'll do that for my third map.

Fist alt-fire should reflect projectiles

Push push20's insta-kill-when-lower code on push16's platforms.

Push21 needs more buildings.

Push10 needs a dramatic overhaul. It's laggy and far too easy to stall/camp on.

THere needs to be a reason to use the teleporter in push03, at the moment it's only a trap.

In push17 (Caco), needs to play OM NOM NOM when someone enters his mouth.


[06:27:59 pm] playe: hey term
[06:28:01 pm] TerminusEst13: Yo.
[06:28:09 pm] playe: are you going to make the spawn sound a dial up tone as well?
[06:28:17 pm] TerminusEst13: ...hahaha, that's a good idea.
[06:28:24 pm] playe: i think so, if doable
[06:28:34 pm] PresidentPeople: Heh, dialup


[06:32:36 pm] PresidentPeople: Getting dunked should call and A_Quake on the victim
[06:32:46 pm] PresidentPeople: for extra dunk feels


Shadows under platforms in push09.


<Marcaek> TerminusEst13, perhaps some kind of less random mode to spawn in a drone every X intervals?
<Marcaek> or wait
<Marcaek> random spawn point :?
<TerminusEst13> That's a good idea. I'll go with that, thanks.
<Marcaek> oooh

Replace teleport fog. Reverse version of the player deaths?

Push20 and push34 needs one player 1 start.

Painting/drawing utensil.

Slow down ground on push08

Rise up floors in push04


<PresidentPeople> The camp spot [in Push24] was moved to the middle, but the outer platform is pretty bare now
<PresidentPeople> what about a slope up to the jump pad?
<PresidentPeople> That is, a slope to a slightly higher shelf


<PresidentPeople> TerminusEst13: Kurashiki pointed out to me that the chocolate bar's texture is off-center on her map.  It must've become misaligned after the adjustments
<TerminusEst13> ...Oops. Thanks for letting me know.


<PresidentPeople> Small issue on the StarTropics map.  There's a very tiny ledge behind Mike's portrait, but only on his left, strangely


Make walls on push35 further out, reduce size of main arena.


<Untitled> unless your map is very complex (lots of detail and whatnot), sheer size shouldn't be that deadly
<PresidentPeople> I know people asked for big maps, but they're turning out to be hard to play on once the players dwindle away
<TerminusEst13> Yeah.
<PresidentPeople> Whether they're survivors, or a small group to begin with
<WaTaKiD> so have the map shrink depending on # players left :p
<WaTaKiD> some outer pillars lower to the floor or something idk
<TerminusEst13> That's not a bad idea, Wata.
<PresidentPeople> yeah, that sounds neat
<TerminusEst13> It'll take revising and rebuilding every single big map available, but it's possible with GetPlayerCount.
<WaTaKiD> gl hf
<WaTaKiD> if that idea causes more trouble than its worth in the end, my apologies lol


<PresidentPeople> Maybe if Push33 was broken up with some kind of walls
<PresidentPeople> to keep less 3D floors in the FOV
<TerminusEst13> The problem isn't the 3D floors, oddly, the problem is all of the actors.
<TerminusEst13> There's...almost three megabytes of the map dedicated to the sprites alone.
<PresidentPeople> Wow
<TerminusEst13> Yeah. I deleted half of them (the ones not in view behind the map) and that halved the filesize, but there's still around I think 500 actors.
<PresidentPeople> Could a texture of some kind be used as a substitute, with actors used more sparingly?
<TerminusEst13> It's possible, since a lot of other maps use it (push29 first comes to mind), so it definitely can be done. I'm not personally familiar with how, but I'll have to check it out and see how viable it is.
<PresidentPeople> Also, the coral isn't forcing x-billboarding
<PresidentPeople> er
<PresidentPeople> y-billboarding



<DRL333> Speaking of faces, I know why the face texture in Push13 doesn't look right in software
<DRL333> The texture's resoulution is causing it to bork in software
<DRL333> It's the same thing that's happening to the NES is Seth's map
<DRL333> Changing the resoultion to something like 256 x 256 should fix it



Make push10's flashing red/blue textures less frequent.

uq-pushmap.wad (Save for Zandro 2.0)
TerminusEst13: Would you be all right with it if I moved the pillars on the east and the west back a little bit to the edge of the platforms? I can already see players wanting to hide behind them to let everyone else fight it out.
universal quantifier: Sure
